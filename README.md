• Employing the rules of a grammar, this program allowed users to construct any number of random sentences
• Breaking down grammar rules into a collection of different objects and recursively calling the methods designated
to each object would result in the objects being turned into immutable sentence fragments. Upon combining these
fragments, a complete sentence would have been made
• Administered a recursive algorithm that relies on the duck typing mechanism present in Python to achieve a fast
runtime complexity. Generators were utilized to minimize space complexity and increase overall efficienc
